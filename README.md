# Flocking Simulation
## Description
**Boids** is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the [flocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior) "Flocking (behavior)") behaviour of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object. Incidentally, "boid" is also a New York Metropolitan dialect pronunciation for "bird".

As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence "Emergence") behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

-   **separation**: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
-   **alignment**: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
-   **cohesion**: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

More complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking.
